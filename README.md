# Ownables SDK

![ownables](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100821/177121121-a1c3dc8c-8108-4c07-9e15-b83ebfdf8f98.png)

Ownables are CosmWasm smart contracts that define ownership. In addition to running on a Cosmos blockchain, Ownables
can run directly in a wallet using the [LTO Network](https://ltonetwork.com) private layer.

The SDK contains examples and tools for developing Ownables.

## Quickstart

This quickstart is written for Linux/Mac devices, for Windows please refer to the [Windows quickstart](#windows-quickstart).

```
npm i
npm run rustup
npm run ownables:build-all
npm start
```

Once that is done, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and you should see an empty wallet that is ready to import Ownable
packages.

In the wallet, click the ï¼‹ icon at the bottom right. This will open an action menu in which we can choose to import a
new Ownable from a file and select a zipped package. The packages are located in the `ownables` folder.

Please read the [documentation](https://docs.ltonetwork.com/ownables/what-are-ownables) to learn more about Ownables.


# SDK Wallet

The wallet is a React application that can be used to test Ownables.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the
build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


# Ownables

## Prerequisites

Rustup, so that you can set up the wasm32 target:
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

rustup default stable
cargo version

rustup update stable

rustup target list --installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Alternatively run `npm run rustup`.

## Build

```
npm run ownables:build --package=car
```

## Examples

### Car

A static Ownable, with a widget that shows an MP4 loop of a car.

### Potion

An basic stateful Ownable. The potion gets a random color when instantiated. You can
drink a portion of the potion, until it's empty.

### Robot

An Ownable to showcase Consumables. The robot will change as it consumes an upgrade.

Consumables are Ownables with a `consume` method. The following Consumables are available for the robot:

#### Paint

A Consumable with a random color. Consume it to change the color of the robot.

#### Antenna

Adds an antenna to the robot. Only one antenna can be added.

#### Speakers

Adds speakers to the robot. Only one set of speakers can be added.

#### Armor

Adds armor to the robot. Only one shield can be added.

## Windows quickstart

The Windows quickstart is similar to the regular quickstart, but by default you will not be able to run certain commands that are in the package.json file.

You also need to ensure that you have the latest visual studio community installed, with clang tools enabled.

This guide helps you set up the necessities so that you can run the ownables-sdk on a Windows machine.

### **1. Install npm packages**
```bash
npm i
```

### **2. Setup npm so it uses git bash**

In order to be able to run the scripts, you need to ensure that npm is not using the default `cmd` shell, but instead uses `git-bash`.

To do this, go to your `.npmrc` file (usually located in `~/.npmrc`, and add the following:
```bash
script-shell=C:\Program Files\git\bin\bash.exe
shell=C:\Program Files\git\bin\bash.exe
```

### **3. Rustup**
Run the following command so that you can set up the wasm32 target:
```bash
npm run rustup
```
This will also automatically install visual studio community, which is required to be able to proceed.

### **4. Configure visual studio community (VSC)**
You can configure VSC during the initial installation, or alternatively, after the installation is done by opening the `Visual Studio Installer`.

From there you can modify the settings. Ensure that you enable the following configuration in the VSC installer:
```
Select "Desktop development with C++"
Under "Desktop development with C++", select "C++ clang tools for windows"
```

Finally, add clang to your path, which should be located here:
```
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin
```

### **5. Build ownables**
You will need the `zip` command to proceed, which by default Windows does not have.

There are many ways to add this, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55749636) is an example on how to install `zip`.

Once you have access to the zip command, you can begin building all the ownables:
```
npm run ownables:build-all
```

If the build is successful, you can run `npm start` which spins up the server.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the wallet and begin importing ownables!
